                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer, Multimedia Designer and Artist.</p>
                <p>I like painting, drawing and design, which I consider adds a creative side to my profile.</p>
                <p>I studied Multimedia Design at <strong>Primera Escula de Arte Multimedial Da Vinci</strong>, not long after I graduated, I entered <strong>Henry</strong>'s bootcamp, where i learned HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for Front-end develpment, which I belive comes from my creative side and my interest in programming.</p>
                <p>One thing that I love about the world of programming is the fact that it's so wide, there's always something new and interesting to learn.</p>
                <p>Currently, IÂ´m teaching at <strong>Primera Escula de Arte Multimedial Da Vinci</strong>. I teach technologies such as: HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, REACT, FIREBASE and JAVASCRIPT.</p>
